Persistent local MCP relay for developer machines.

`mcp-local-relay` runs once on localhost, keeps upstream MCP servers warm, caches tool discovery, exposes health/status, and lets agents hot-add or refresh upstream MCP servers through MCP tools. Point Codex, Claude Code, Antigravity, Cursor, and desktop apps at one fast local MCP endpoint instead of duplicating the same MCP connections in every session.

> **Status: v0.1 — public initial release.** Streamable HTTP upstreams, cached
> tool discovery, hot-swap MCP onboarding tools, PostHog CLI-mode preset,
> macOS LaunchAgent helpers, JSON health/status endpoints, and a SwiftUI status
> bar app source package are implemented. Start with
> [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and
> [docs/STATUS-BAR.md](docs/STATUS-BAR.md).

## Why

Raw MCP clients often do eager startup discovery. Remote or large MCP servers can slow launch, fail on auth, or inject huge tool schemas into context. If you run several agent sessions, each one tends to start its own copy of the same MCP connections.

A persistent local relay gives you:

- fast localhost startup
- one shared MCP instance for many Codex, Claude Code, Antigravity, Cursor, or desktop sessions
- cached `tools/list`
- low-context provider presets, starting with PostHog CLI mode
- LaunchAgent lifecycle and logs on macOS
- `/healthz` and `/status`
- hot-swap onboarding via MCP management tools

## How it works

1. **One local MCP endpoint** — clients connect once to `127.0.0.1`.
2. **Persistent upstreams** — remote MCP servers stay warm outside the client process.
3. **Cached discovery** — `tools/list` is served from a local cache while refreshes happen in the background.
4. **Hot-swap onboarding** — agents use `relay_*` MCP tools to add, validate, refresh, enable, or disable upstream servers.
5. **Observable runtime** — LaunchAgent logs plus `/healthz` and `/status` make failures inspectable.

## Install

```sh
pnpm add -g mcp-local-relay
mcp-local-relayctl init
mcp-local-relayctl install
mcp-local-relayctl start
```

Update later with:

```sh
mcp-local-relayctl upgrade
```

The LaunchAgent points at the installed global CLI path, so upgrading the package and restarting the agent moves every client session to the latest relay without changing client MCP config. If your global install uses a specific package manager, pass `--package-manager pnpm`, `npm`, `yarn`, or `bun`.

For development from a checkout:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build
node bin/mcp-local-relay.mjs serve --config examples/config.posthog.json
```

## Client Config

Point every client at the relay once:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-local-relay": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3764/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

After that, Codex, Claude Code, Antigravity, Cursor, and other Streamable HTTP MCP clients can share the same local endpoint:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3764/mcp
```

Use the relay's MCP tools or CLI to add or update upstream servers without editing every client config again.

## Add MCP Servers

An upstream server config looks like this:

```json
{
  "id": "posthog",
  "name": "PostHog",
  "category": "Product analytics",
  "mode": "posthog-cli",
  "remote": {
    "type": "streamable_http",
    "url": "https://mcp.posthog.com/mcp"
  },
  "envFile": "~/.config/mcp-local-relay/posthog.env",
  "cache": {
    "toolsTtlMs": 900000
  }
}
```

### Warm Add From An Agent

Ask any agent connected to the relay to call `relay_add_server` with the server config:

```json
{
  "id": "docs",
  "name": "Docs",
  "category": "Documentation",
  "remote": {
    "type": "streamable_http",
    "url": "https://your-docs-mcp.example.com/mcp"
  },
  "cache": {
    "toolsTtlMs": 900000
  }
}
```

`relay_add_server` validates the upstream MCP, opens the connection, caches `tools/list`, persists the config, and emits `notifications/tools/list_changed` so clients that support it can see the new tools without restarting.

### Warm Add From The CLI

Use one of the example server files, or create your own:

```sh
mcp-local-relayctl add --file examples/server.posthog.json --warm
mcp-local-relayctl add --file examples/server.docs.json --warm
```

`--warm` sends the config to the running local relay. Without `--warm`, the CLI edits the config file offline:

```sh
mcp-local-relayctl add --file examples/server.search.json
mcp-local-relayctl restart
```

More examples live in [`examples/`](examples/).

## Hot-Swap Tools

The relay exposes management tools:

- `relay_list_servers`
- `relay_add_server`
- `relay_update_server`
- `relay_remove_server`
- `relay_enable_server`
- `relay_disable_server`
- `relay_refresh_tools`
- `relay_get_status`
- `relay_get_client_config`
- `relay_validate_server`

When a server is added, updated, removed, enabled, disabled, or refreshed, the relay emits `notifications/tools/list_changed`. Clients that honor the notification can see new tools without a session restart.

## PostHog Preset

Use `mode: "posthog-cli"` to request PostHog's slim CLI MCP surface. Store the API token in an env file:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/mcp-local-relay
umask 077
printf 'POSTHOG_MCP_API_TOKEN=phx_...\n' > ~/.config/mcp-local-relay/posthog.env
```

The token is read at runtime and is not written into client config or LaunchAgent plists.

## LaunchAgent vs stdio

Stdio MCP is simple, but each client process pays startup, auth, and discovery costs. A LaunchAgent relay persists outside the client, keeps logs, warms caches, and can be inspected independently.

## Status

```sh
mcp-local-relayctl status
mcp-local-relayctl logs
curl http://127.0.0.1:3764/status
```

The optional macOS menu bar app shows the same local relay state:

<p>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unsoldgroup/mcp-local-relay/main/docs/assets/status-bar-menu.png" alt="mcp-local-relay macOS menu bar status showing four MCP servers and thirty-six tools." width="235">
</p>

The optional macOS status bar app lives in
`macos/McpLocalRelayStatusBar`. It is a small SwiftUI `MenuBarExtra` app
that reads the local admin API, shows relay/server status, refreshes upstream
tool caches, restarts the LaunchAgent-backed relay, opens the logs folder, and
copies client config without reading env files.

```sh
cd macos/McpLocalRelayStatusBar
swift run
```

To install it as a login item from a checkout:

```sh
pnpm install:status-bar
```

That builds the app into `~/Applications/Mcp Local Relay Status Bar.app`,
registers `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.unsoldgroup.mcp-local-relay-status-bar.plist`,
and opens it immediately. Remove it with:

```sh
pnpm uninstall:status-bar
```

The local admin API used by the app is:

- `GET /status`
- `GET /client-config`
- `POST /servers/:id/refresh`
- `POST /restart`
